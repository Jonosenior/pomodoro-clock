Goal: To create a browser-based workflow timer to practice HTML, CSS and Javascript. Project idea taken from the Odin Project [https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project].

Issues to fix:
- Button functionality - when you double click start or restart, the clock counts down double fast.
- Time lag - the clock often counts down an extra second after the user clicks stop.

Possible future features:
- Text in the top left of the screen notifying user if he/she is in work, break or stop mode.
- A sound cue indicating that there is 30 seconds left of work mode.
- A sound cue indicating that break mode has arrived.
- Allow the user to set the timer in minutes.
